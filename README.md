# Hi, I'm Lihan (LihanCanCode)

I build secure, polished web experiences and constantly experiment with modern JavaScript tooling. My current focus is on crafting delightful user interfaces and backend services that scale cleanly.

## What I am working on
- Shipping a security-focused portfolio with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.
- Exploring ways to harden frontend apps through better auth flows and threat modeling.
- Documenting real-world learnings so other developers can build safer products faster.

## Core skills
- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C++
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Backend & DevOps: Node.js, Express, Prisma, Docker, PostgreSQL
- Security: OWASP Top 10 awareness, threat modeling, secure code reviews

## Featured projects
- [SEC Portfolio](https://github.com/LihanCanCode/sec-portfolio) — Interactive personal site showcasing security engineering work, motion design, and responsive layouts.
- [Secure API Boilerplate](https://github.com/LihanCanCode/secure-api-boilerplate) — Starter kit for building hardened REST APIs with role-based access control. *(Update this link if the repository name differs.)*
- [CTF Toolkit](https://github.com/LihanCanCode/ctf-toolkit) — Utilities and scripts that speed up capture-the-flag competition workflows. *(Update this link if the repository name differs.)*

## Highlights
